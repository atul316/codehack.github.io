            <p class="ml-6 lg:ml-20">1) C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. <br>
                2) C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.<br>
                3) C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. <br>
                4) The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.<br>

                <h2 class="ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">Why learn C++?</h2>
                <p class="ml-6 lg:ml-20">1) C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.<br>
                    2) C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.<br>
                    3) C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.<br>
                    4) C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.<br>
                    5) C++ is fun and easy to learn!<br>
                    6) As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.<br>

                    <h2 class="ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">Difference between C and C++ :</h2>
                    <p class="ml-6 lg:ml-20">1) C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.<br>
                        2) The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.<br>

                <h2 class="ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">Quickstart for C++ :</h2>
                <p class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">Let's create our first C++ file. <br>

Open Codeblocks (you can open any other software as well) and go to File -> New -> Empty File. <br>
                    
Write the following C++ code and save the file as myfirstprogram.cpp (File -> Save) <br>

<b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp#include< iostream> <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspusing namespace std;<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspint main() <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp{ <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcout << "Hello World!"; <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn 0; <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp} <br></b>
                
Don't worry if you don't understand the code above. For now, focus on how to run the code. <br>
                   
In Codeblocks, it should look like this: <br>
<img src="c++_code.png" alt="C Code"><br>
Then, go to Build > Build and Run to run (execute) the program. The result will look something to this: <br>
<img src="run_window.png" alt="Output Code"><br>
    <b>Congratulations!</b> You have now written and executed your first C++ program.

                <h2 class="ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">Advantages of C++ :</h2>
                <li class="ml-12 mt-3">C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It may be a collection of commands, which tell the pc to try to do “something.” This collection of commands is typically called C++ ASCII text files.</li>
                <li class="ml-12 mt-1"> C++ could also be a problem-oriented language that’s much easier to use than the other low-level languages like binary coding. It takes much more space than low-level languages but it’s much easier to understand and learn.</li>
                <li class="ml-12 mt-1">C++ program has many advantages when it involves programming, All C++ program stand-alone files must use the foremost function to allow the program to start out up and motivate its functions.</li>
                <li class="ml-12 mt-1">C++ program can support unions and structures that are a mix of stand-alone and put-together files, It uses the standard C++ application mentioned as “.cpp”, C++ uses the reserved library word mentioned as “goto” that’s the same as Java’s continue, or break commands.</li>

                <h2 class=" ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">Disadvantages of C++ :</h2>
                <li class="ml-12 mt-3">One major problem in C++ is when the info points to an equivalent thing from two different starting points, this causes a serious problem, the C++ program will still have involved problems within the coding.</li>
                <li class="ml-12 mt-1">C++ program can’t support garbage pickup, It doesn’t support Dynamic Memory Allocation, it’s not secure because it’s a pointer, friend function, and global variable and it’s no support for threads built-in.</li>
                <li class="ml-12 mt-1">It is used for platform-specific applications commonly.</li>
                <li class="ml-12 mt-1"> C++ program is complex during a very large high-level program, C++ is employed for platform-specific application commonly, For the actual OS or platform, the library set is typically chosen.</li>
                <li class="ml-12 mt-1">Java’s uni-code to the ASCII rules is 16-bit, while C++ program is 8-bit only, So, C++ may be a less impressive programming language but saves the memory.</li>

                <h2 class=" ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">What To Avoid in C++ :</h2>
                <li class="ml-12 mt-1">Don’t put “using namespace std;” into headers.</li>
                <li class="ml-12 mt-3">Avoid calling virtual functions in constructors</li>
                    <li class="ml-12 mt-1">Learn about const correctness. Any method that doesn’t alter class state should be marked const, and any reference you’re not going to change should be const.</li>
                    <li class="ml-12 mt-1">Don’t use new/delete.</li>
