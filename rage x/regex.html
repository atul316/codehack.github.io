    <p class="ml-6 lg:ml-20">1) Short for regular expression, a regex is a string of text that lets you create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text. <br>
        2) Perl is a great example of a programming language that utilizes regular expressions. <br>
        3) Database management system (DBMS) utilises queries to pull out information from the database. <br>
        4) However, its only one of the many places you can find regular expressions. Regular expressions can also be used from the command line and in text editors to find text within a file. <br>
        5) Regular expressions are useful in search and replace operations. <br>
        6) The typical use case is to look for a sub-string that matches a pattern and replace it with something else. Most APIs using regular expressions allow you to reference capture groups from the search pattern in the replacement string.

        <h2 class="ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">How to write regular expression?</h2>
        <p class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">1) Repeaters : * , + and { }: <li class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">These symbols act as repeaters and tell the computer that the preceding character is to be used for more than just one time.</li> </p> <br>
        <p class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">2) The asterisk symbol ( * ): <li class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">It tells the computer to match the preceding character (or set of characters) for 0 or more times (upto infinite).</li> </p> <br>
        <p class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">3) The Plus symbol ( + ): <li class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">It tells the computer to repeat the preceding character (or set of characters) for atleast one or more times(upto infinite).</li> </p> <br>
        <p class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">4) The curly braces {…}: <li class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">It tells the computer to repeat the preceding character (or set of characters) for as many times as the value inside this bracket.</li> </p> <br>
        <p class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">5) Wildcard - ( . ): <li class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">The dot symbol can take place of any other symbol, that is why it is called the wildcard character.</li> </p> <br>
        <p class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">6) Optional character - ( ? ): <li class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">This symbol tells the computer that the preceding character may or may not be present in the string to be matched.</li> </p> <br>
        <p class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">7) The caret ( ^ ) symbol: <li class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">Setting position for match :tells the computer that the match must start at the beginning of the string or line.</li> </p> <br>
        <p class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">8) The dollar ( $ ) symbol: <li class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">It tells the computer that the match must occur at the end of the string or before \n at the end of the line or string.</li> </p> <br>

        <h2 class="ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">Components of REGEX :</h2>
        <p class="ml-6 lg:ml-20"><b>1) A character class : </b> matches any one of a set of characters. It is used to match the most basic element of a language like a letter, a digit, space, a symbol etc. <br>
            /s : matches any whitespace characters such as space and tab <br>
            /S : matches any non-whitespace characters <br>
            /d : matches any digit character <br>
            /D : matches any non-digit characters <br>
            /w : matches any word character (basically alpha-numeric) <br>
            /W : matches any non-word character <br>
            /b : matches any word boundary (this would include spaces, dashes, commas, semi-colons, etc)
            <li class="ml-12 mt-3">The Escape Symbol : \ <br>
                If you want to match for the actual '+', '.' etc characters, add a backslash( \ ) before that character. This will tell the computer to treat the following character as a search character and consider it for matching pattern.
            </li>
            <li class="ml-12 mt-3">Grouping Characters ( ) <br>
                A set of different symbols of a regular expression can be grouped together to act as a single unit and behave as a block, for this, you need to wrap the regular expression in the parenthesis( ).
            </li>
            <li class="ml-12 mt-3">Vertical Bar ( | ) : <br>
                Matches any one element separated by the vertical bar (|) character.
            </li>
            <li class="ml-12 mt-3">\number : <br>
                Backreference: allows a previously matched sub-expression   (expression captured or enclosed within circular brackets ) to be identified subsequently in the same regular expression. \n means that group enclosed within the n-th bracket will be repeated at current position.
            </li>
            <li class="ml-12 mt-3">Comment : (?# comment) - <br>
                Inline comment: The comment ends at the first closing parenthesis.
            </li>

    <h2 class="ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">Performance Pitfalls :</h2>
    <li class="ml-12 mt-3">You should know some things about how your regex engine works since two "equivalent" regexes can have drastic differences in processing speed. <br>
        ◉ It is possible to write regexes that take exponential time to match, but you pretty much have to TRY to make one (they're pathological) <br>
        ◉ It is more common to accidentally create regexes that run in quadratic time
    </li>
    <li class="ml-12 mt-1">Main types of problems <br>
        ◉ Recompilation (from forgetting to compile regexes used multiple times) <br>
        ◉ Dot-star in the Middle (which causes backtracking) <br>
                   -Solution 1: Use negated character class <br>
                   -Solution 2: Use reluctant quantifiers <br>
        ◉ Nested Repetition

    <h2 class=" ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">Performance Tips :</h2>
    <li class="ml-12 mt-3">Use non-capturing groups when you need parentheses but not capture.</li>
    <li class="ml-12 mt-1">If the regex is very complex, do a quick spot-check before attempting a match, e.g. <br>
        ◉ Does an email address contain '@'?
    </li>
    <li class="ml-12 mt-1">Present the most likely alternative first, e.g. <br>
        ◉ black| white|blue| red|green| metallic seaweed
    </li>
    <li class="ml-12 mt-1">Reduce the amount of looping the engine has to do <br> 
        ◉ \d\d\d\d\d is faster than \d{5}
        ◉ aaaa+ is faster than a{4,}
    </li>
    <li class="ml-12 mt-1">Avoid obvious backtrack e.g. <br>
        ◉ Mr|Ms| Mrs should be M(?:rs?|s)
        ◉ Good morning |Good evening should be Good (?:morning| evening)

        <ul>
            <li class="ml-12 mt-3"> • Java's built-in support for regexes exceeds that of many languages <br>
                The overhead costs of using a DBMS are due to the following:
                <br>
                •  Especially good for Unicode and for character classes (has more than Perl)
                <br>
                • Syntax is more cumbersome (string literal support weak, no operator for matching...) — live with it!
                <br>
                • Perl has nice regex, too, even allows you can even embed code inside them.
                <br>
                Great Perl document at the perldoc pages perlrequick, perlretut, perlre. and perlreref.
                <br>
                • JavaScript seems to less extensive support than other languages, but I think this is changing.
                <br>
                • Python puts regex functions in a module.
