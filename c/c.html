            <p class="ml-6 lg:ml-20">C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It isa very popular language, despite being old. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

                <h2 class="ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">Why learn C?</h2>
                <p class="ml-6 lg:ml-20">1) It is one of the most popular programming language in the world<br>
                    2) If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as
                    Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar<br>
                    3) C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python<br>
                    4) C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies<br>

                <h2 class="ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">Quickstart for C</h2>
                <p class=" ml-6 lg:ml-20">Let's create our first C file. <br>

Open Codeblocks (you can open any other software as well) and go to File -> New -> Empty File. <br>
                    
Write the following C code and save the file as myfirstprogram.c (File -> Save) <br>

<b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp#include< stdio.h> <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspint main() <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp{ <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspprintf("Hello World!"); <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn 0; <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp} <br></b>
                
Don't worry if you don't understand the code above. For now, focus on how to run the code. <br>
                   
In Codeblocks, it should look like this: <br>
<img src="codeblock.png" alt="C Code"><br>
Then, go to Build > Build and Run to run (execute) the program. The result will look something to this: <br>
<img src="run_window.png" alt="Output Code"><br>
    <b>Congratulations!</b> You have now written and executed your first C program.

                <h2 class="ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">Advantages of C :</h2>
                <li class="ml-8 lg:ml-12 mt-3">C language is a building block for many other currently known languages. C language has variety of data types and powerful operators. Due to this, programs written in C language are efficient, fast and easy to understand.
                </li>
                <li class="ml-8 lg:ml-12 mt-1"> C is highly portable language. This means that C programs written for one computer can easily run on another computer without any change or by doing a little change.</li>
                <li class="ml-8 lg:ml-12 mt-1">There are only 32 keywords in ANSI C and its strength lies in its built-in functions. Several standard functions are available which can be used for developing programs.</li>
                <li class="ml-8 lg:ml-12 mt-1">C language is a structured programming language. This makes user to think of a problem in terms of function modules or blocks. Collection of these modules makes a complete program. This modular structure makes program debugging, testing and maintenance easier.</li>

                <h2 class=" ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">Disadvantages of C :</h2>
                <li class="ml-8 lg:ml-12 mt-3">C does not have concept of OOPs, that’s why C++ is developed.
                </li>
                <li class="ml-8 lg:ml-12 mt-1">There is no runtime checking in C language.</li>
                <li class="ml-8 lg:ml-12 mt-1">There is no strict type checking. For example, we can pass an integer value.</li>
                <li class="ml-8 lg:ml-12 mt-1"> C doesn’t have the concept of namespace.</li>
                <li class="ml-8 lg:ml-12 mt-1">C doesn’t have the concept of constructor or destructor.</li>

                <h2 class=" ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">What To Avoid in C :</h2>
                    <li class="ml-8 lg:ml-12 mt-3">Mixing signed and unsigned integers</li>
                    <li class="ml-8 lg:ml-12 mt-1">Reading an array out of bounds</li>
                    <li class="ml-8 lg:ml-12 mt-1">Using void for generic pointers to memory</li>
