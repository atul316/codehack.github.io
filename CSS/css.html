            <p class="ml-6 lg:ml-20">1) CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets<br>
                2) CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media<br>
                3) CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once<br>
                4) External stylesheets are stored in CSS files<br>

                <h2 class="ml-4 lg:ml-12 mt-1 font-bold">CSS Solved a Big Problem :</h2>
                <p class="ml-6 lg:ml-20">HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!<br>
                    HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like: <br>
                    < h1>This is a heading< /h1> <br>
                    < p>This is a paragraph.< /p> <br>
                    When tags like < font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process. <br>
                    To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS. <br>
                    CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
